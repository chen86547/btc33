The connection between virtual currency and traditional currency is mainly reflected in the following aspects:


Value transfer: Virtual currency can be used as a means of value transfer, used to purchase goods and services, pay debts, or as an investment tool.


Money supply: The money supply of virtual currencies is usually limited, such as Bitcoinâ€™s maximum supply of 21 million units. This limited supply can help maintain the value stability of virtual currencies.


Taxation: Virtual currency transactions may be affected by tax policies, so relevant tax regulations need to be followed.


Laws and regulations: The use of virtual currencies may be restricted by laws and regulations in different countries and regions, so you need to understand the relevant laws and regulations and comply with their requirements.
